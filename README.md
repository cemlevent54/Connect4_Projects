# Connect4_Projects

There are 2 project about connect game.

1-) Connect4.c
This is classic Connect 4 game. This game is played on 6x7 board. 
If four X or four O creates a line horizontally, vertically or diagonally; created one wins the game.
I wrote it in C but it can be written in c++ by learning some c++.

2-) MxN_Connect_X.c++
MxN Connect X is improved from connect 4. This game takes row and column input from user. In addition,
it takes how many unit required to win. 
For example, you input row number as 6,column number as 8 and unit number as 5; then if five X or five O
creates a line; created one wins the game.

I continue to develop this project. If you have any question or recognize some mistakes, ask it me.
